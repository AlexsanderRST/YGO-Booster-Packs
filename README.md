    - In the game, open the deck editor and load the deck (wait until all cards are loaded);
    - Copy the EDOPRO's pics folder into the main folder.
  - Downloader (slow, high res):
    - Download the [EDOPRO HD Downloader](https://github.com/NiiMiyo/EDOPro-Hd-Downloader) from @NiiMiyo;
    - Extract the zip to the main folder;
    - Open the exe file and type 'allcards';
    - Wait for the download to finish.
