### Setup ‚öôÔ∏è:
- Download the exe from the Itchio page;
- The cards' artworks aren't included and the automatic downloader is not implemented. There are two alternatives:
  - EDOPRO (fast, low res):
    - Copy *cards.ydk* from the deck folder into the EDOPRO deck folder;
    - In the game, open the deck editor and load the deck (wait until all cards are loaded);
    - Copy the EDOPRO's pics folder into the main folder.
  - Downloader (slow, high res):
    - Download the [EDOPRO HD Downloader](https://github.com/NiiMiyo/EDOPro-Hd-Downloader) from @NiiMiyo;
    - Extract the zip to the main folder;
    - Open the exe file and type 'allcards';
    - Wait for the download to finish.
- The pack's artworks aren't included:
  - Download them manually and drop them in the pics/booster folder;
  - The format should be .png and the name should follow the official prefix;
